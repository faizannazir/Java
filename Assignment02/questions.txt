Q.1: (Palindromes)  A  palindrome  is  a  sequence  of  characters  that  reads  the 
same backward as forward. For example, each of the following five-digit integers 
is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 and 11611. Write an application that reads 
in a five-digit integer and determines whether it’s a palindrome. If the number is 
not five digits long, display an error message and allow the user to enter a new 
value.
Q.2: (Salary  Calculator)  Develop  a  Java  application  that  determines  the  gross 
pay for each of three employees. The company pays straight time for the first 40 
hours worked by each employee and time and a half for all hours worked in excess 
of  40.  You’re  given  a  list  of  the  employees,  their  number  of  hours  worked  last 
week and their hourly rates. Your program should input this information for each 
employee,  then  determine  and  display  the  employee’s  gross  pay.  Use  class 
Scanner to input the data.
Q.3: The replace() method searches a string for a specified character, and returns 
a new string where the specified character(s) are replaced. The synntax of the 
replace method is as under 
Syntax
public String replace(char searchChar, char newChar)
Now make a java program and use the replace function. Take a string “ Waheed” 
and replace the characters “W and D” with “N”
